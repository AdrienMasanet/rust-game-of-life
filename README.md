# Rust game of life

Hi! Here's my attempt to make the [John Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using [the Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr) and [macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/), a high level graphics crate. I did this to exercice myself while studying some stuff about Rust so there may be some mistakes, if I notice something wrong i'll commit a fix.
